    <h1>burning fossil fuels</h1>
    <p>Environmental pollution from fossil fuels impacts humans because particulates and other air pollution from
        fossil fuel combustion cause illness and death when inhaled. These health effects include premature death,
        acute respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. The poor,
        undernourished, very young and very old, and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill
        health are more at risk. Global air pollution deaths due to fossil fuels have been estimated at over 8
        million people (2018, nearly 1 in 5 deaths worldwide) at 10.2 million (2019), and 5.13 million
        excess deaths from ambient air pollution from fossil fuel use (2023).

        While all energy sources inherently have adverse effects, the data show that fossil fuels cause the highest
        levels of greenhouse gas emissions and are the most dangerous for human health. In contrast, modern
        renewable energy sources appear to be safer for human health and cleaner. The death rates from accidents and
        air pollution in the EU are as follows per terawatt-hour</p>
